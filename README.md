# But, yea. coming soon... Twzilr's - 🚁 🚁 🚁 🚁 🚁

### Overview
-------

This app is a side-project I'm developing using React, Redux, ES6, and Firebase as the data store. I have learned a great deal from building this application, now for the third time. The first time I made it with jQuery, the second time with AngularJS.

It is a great example of what a real-world application might be like, which makes it perfect to build it using different technologies that I want to learn or get better with.


### Installation
-------

The NPM scripts for this project to do various things like build, start the server, etc. are configured to run using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/). It is recommended that you install Yarn to take advantage of the benefits of using it instead of NPM.

### Installing & Running:
------

# I use Yarn, you should too. It's just better...

`brew install yarn`

# Clone && cd && yarn 
```
git clone git@github.com:jaredwilli/webernote-react.git
cd webernote-react
yarn
```

# Running Server:
------
`yarn start`

_The app will be served on `(http://localhost:3000/)`.

# Building:

This is still a Create React App unejected. (Sounds so weird...)
But there are tons of cool things you can do
```
# Building
yarn build
Yarn build-start

# Testing
yarn test  [-- --jsdom]
yarn coverage   [--

# Sass Watching/Building
```
yarn watch-css
yarn build-css
```



To view a list of all the runnable NPM commands use:

`yarn run`

This will show various things like coverage, watch-css, different options for prod/dev environments and more.
