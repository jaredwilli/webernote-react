## Overview
-------

This app is a side-project I'm developing using React, Redux, ES6, and Firebase as the data store. I have learned a great deal from building this application, now for the third time. The first time I made it with jQuery, the second time with AngularJS.

It is a great example of what a real-world application might be like, which makes it perfect to build it using different technologies that I want to learn or get better with.

## Install
------

Yarn helps to spead things up a bit, but I use npm as well.

`brew install yarn`

## Clone && cd && yarn
```
git clone git@github.com:jaredwilli/webernote-react.git
cd webernote-react
yarn
```

## Running Server:
------
`yarn start`

_The app will be served on `(http://localhost:3000/)`.
It should also open the browser automatically and load the page.

## Building - Testing - Wathing
-------
This is still a Create React App unejected. (Sounds so weird...)
But there are tons of cool things you can do

### Building
```
yarn build
Yarn build-start
```

### Testing
```
yarn test  [-- --jsdom]
yarn coverage   [--
```

### Sass Watching/Building
```
yarn watch-css
yarn build-css
```

***ORRR..... Read the code :)

### Get a list of the npm scripts you can run.
--------

`yarn run`


## Prettier Configuration

This app uses prettier to auto format the code on pre-commit. It also has a .prettierrc file for setting some defaults. It is recommended that you install Prettier in your code editor of choice and configure your workspace settings for it to be the same as what this project has defined.


## Contributing
-------
Everyone is welcome, we can turn it into a really useful app together!
Of course I am open to anyone looking to contribute. This app is kind of a what I use to build a real-world and production level and quality application using technologies I am not very familiar with so I can pick it up while building a pretty complex single-page-app.

If you are interested in contributing to this project, check out the Issues page and choose from any of the various features, bugs, ideas and other things that you may want to give a shot to add, and open a Pull Request.
