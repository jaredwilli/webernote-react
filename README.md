### Overview
-------

This app is a side-project I'm developing using React, Redux, ES6, and Firebase as the data store. I have learned a great deal from building this application, now for the third time. The first time I made it with jQuery, the second time with AngularJS.

It is a great example of what a real-world application might be like, which makes it perfect to build it using different technologies that I want to learn or get better with.

### Installation
-------

The NPM scripts for this project to do various things like build, start the server, etc. are configured to run using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/). It is recommended that you install Yarn to take advantage of the benefits of using it instead of NPM.

Install Yarn:
`brew install yarn`

Clone the repo and install the dependencies:

```
git clone git@github.com:jaredwilli/webernote-react.git && cd webernote-react && yarn
```

Then run the server:

`yarn start`

The app will be served on `http://localhost:3000/`.

To build the application for deployment run:

`yarn build`

To view a list of all the runnable NPM commands use:

`yarn run`

This will show various things like coverage, watch-css, different options for prod/dev environments and more.
